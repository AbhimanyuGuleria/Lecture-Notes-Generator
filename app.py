# --- 1. CONCEPT & UI SETUP ---
# The app is designed to be simple. A title, a file uploader, and a place to show the results.
# We use Streamlit's functions like st.title() and st.file_uploader() to create these elements.

# We get the API key from the user via a sidebar input.
# For deployment, it's better to use Streamlit Secrets.
